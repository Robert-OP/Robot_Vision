\chapter{Hardware setup}\label{ch:hardware}
In order to connect to the camera and robot, a personal workstation has been used. Most of the time spent by our group was in the Robotics laboratory, where we worked and tested the ADEPT Cobra robot. We have placed inside the robot cell the camera needed to aquire images of the blocks for further processing. 

The phisical connections to the workstation were made through: 
\begin{itemize}
	\item Ethernet to the robot  
	\item USB to the camera 
\end{itemize}
