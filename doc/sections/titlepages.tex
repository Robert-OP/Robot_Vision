}{% the abstract
  We present a vision-based recognition and localization system using a camera and a robot arm. The aim of this is to create predefined figurines out of LEGO Dublo blocks. The recognition part serves to detect the color of the blocks. Further, the positions and orientations of the needed blocks are calculated by means of image processing methods. Moreover, a translation between the image to robot frames will be done. Finally, the robot will act upon the blocks to move and pick them to construct each figurine.
